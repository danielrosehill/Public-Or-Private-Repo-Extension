I'm working on a VS Code extension. Its purpose is to provide some kind of visual indication to the user to inform them whether the repository which they are working on is a public or private repository. In the first implementation I'm only going to focus on single remote repositories and down the line I might add other ones. Before I begin working on the code, I'm trying to think of what might be a good warning system for the user. The intention is that users will know at a glance what privacy setting is on the GitHub repository so that they won't accidentally commit private information to a public repository. In other words, it's intended as a proactive warning system and a security feature. If I were asked to color code public and private, I would automatically say public should be green and private red, but that's at odds with the workflow in which the warning really applies most strongly to public repositories, because those are the ones that users would not want to commit private info to.  Can you suggest any visual UI elements or iconography that would communicate the intended information in the most intuitive and logical way for the user?

To design a visual indicator system for your VS Code extension that communicates whether a GitHub repository is public or private, you need to balance clarity, intuitiveness, and accessibility. Here are some suggestions for UI elements and iconography:

## **Visual Design Suggestions**

### **1. Color Coding**
- **Public Repositories**: Use a prominent warning color like yellow or orange. This aligns with the idea of caution, as users should be mindful of not committing private information to public repositories.
- **Private Repositories**: Use a neutral or calming color like blue or green to indicate safety and privacy.

Avoid red for private repositories, as it may imply an error or problem, which is not the intended message.

### **2. Icons**
- **Public Repositories**: Use a globe icon to signify "worldwide visibility" or public access. This is widely recognized and intuitive.
- **Private Repositories**: Use a padlock icon to represent restricted access. A lock is universally associated with privacy and security.

### **3. Text Labels**
- Include clear text labels alongside the icons, such as "Public" or "Private." This ensures accessibility for users who may have difficulty interpreting colors or icons alone.

### **4. Badge System**
- Display a small badge in the status bar of VS Code. The badge could include:
  - An icon (globe or padlock).
  - A short label ("Public" or "Private").
  - Optional color coding as described above.

### **5. Tooltip or Hover Information**
- Provide more context when users hover over the badge or icon. For example:
  - Public: "This repository is publicly accessible."
  - Private: "This repository is private and secure."

### **6. Notification System**
- For first-time users or when switching between repositories, display a non-intrusive notification (e.g., a toast message) to inform them about the repository's privacy status.

## **Placement Recommendations**
- Place the indicator in a consistent and visible location within the VS Code interface, such as:
  - The status bar (bottom of the editor).
  - The source control panel header.
  - A dedicated section in the Git panel.

## **Accessibility Considerations**
- Ensure sufficient contrast between colors used for public and private indicators.
- Use text labels alongside icons for clarity.
- Test with assistive technologies to ensure compatibility.

## **Rationale**
These design choices aim to provide an intuitive, non-intrusive, and accessible way for users to quickly identify the privacy status of their repository. By leveraging widely understood symbols (like globes and locks), appropriate color coding, and clear text labels, your extension can effectively reduce user errors and enhance security awareness without overwhelming the user interface.

 Okay, I think those are excellent suggestions. Let's go with the following. Public repos are orange. They have the globe icon and the text label is public in bold. For private repos, let's go with green, padlock and private, but the font should be in regular non-bolded font. Could you summarize the plan for the iconography? 

 # Output 2


### **Public Repositories**
- **Color**: Orange (to signify caution and draw attention).
- **Icon**: Globe icon (to represent worldwide visibility and public access).
- **Text Label**: "Public" in **bold font** (to emphasize the need for caution).

### **Private Repositories**
- **Color**: Green (to signify safety and privacy).
- **Icon**: Padlock icon (to represent restricted access and security).
- **Text Label**: "Private" in regular, non-bolded font (to convey calmness and less urgency).
